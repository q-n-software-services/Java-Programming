 Java doesn't make you deal with possible NullPointerException, or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in your code.
 If these exceptions happen, and are not caught, your program crashes.
 NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and several other exceptions, are called unchecked exceptions.

 It's possible to add try-catch blocks for NullPointerException, and other unchecked exceptions.
 You can also declare that a method throws NullPointerException, or any other unchecked exception

 But, Java insists that you deal with IOException â€“ which is a checked exception - in some way.
 The compiler checks that you have indeed done something about code that can throw IOException.
 You either have to surround your file IO code with a try-catch block, or declare that the method throws IOException.
 If your method throws IOException, then a method that calls this method also has to add a try-catch block, or declare that it also throws IOException.

 There are other checked exceptions, for example SQLException, which you'll see when we work with databases.

 Java's decision to implement two types of exceptions (checked and unchecked) is unusual.
 Other languages like C#, Python, JavaScript... have exceptions, but it's always up to you how to deal with them.
 You are never required to add try-catch blocks or declare that a method throws a particular exception;
 the responsibility is left to the programmer to implement whatever exception/error handling mechanism is appropriate.

 Questions:

 Considering many other languages don't require you to deal with exceptions,
 think about why Java does make you handle with at least some exceptions.

 1. List at least 1 benefit of checked exceptions
 2. List at least 2 negative consequences of checked exceptions
 3. What is your opinion on Java's decision to use checked exceptions?

 Usually, it's better to anticipate and try to prevent errors. Almost all unchecked exceptions can be
 prevented (in theory) by careful programming.  And many checked exceptions can also be prevented with careful coding.

 It's more common for programmers to try to prevent unchecked exceptions (e.g. NullPointerException)
 than to write a try-catch block for code that may throw that type of exception.

 4. For unchecked exceptions, why is it usually better to anticipate and avoid errors when possible,
 instead of using try-catch blocks? At least 2 reasons.


 Questions on this subject are common in Java job interviews so your answers should
 be in the form of an interview question answer.

    String q1_pros_of_checked_exceptions = " The benefits of checked exceptions in Java are:

    They help to ensure that developers handle the exceptions that can occur during the execution of a program. This improves the reliability and robustness of the code.
    They make the code more self-documenting, as the code explicitly declares the exceptions that it may throw.";   //TODO Fill this in with your answer

    String q2_cons_of_checked_exceptions = " The negative consequences of checked exceptions in Java are:

    They can make the code more verbose, as developers have to write try-catch blocks or declare that the method throws an exception. This can make the code harder to read and understand.
    They can make it harder to write generic code, as every method that calls a method that throws a checked exception must either catch the exception or declare that it throws the exception. This can lead to many layers of exception handling, which can be difficult to manage.";   //TODO Fill this in with your answer, at least 2 reasons

    String q3_your_opinion_on_java_having_checked_and_unchecked_exceptions = " My opinion is that Java's decision to use both checked and unchecked exceptions has its pros and cons. On the one hand, checked exceptions can help to improve the reliability and robustness of the code, as they force developers to handle potential exceptions. On the other hand, they can make the code more verbose and harder to read, and they can make it harder to write generic code."; // TODO fill this in with your opinion


    // Why is it often better to anticipate and try to prevent errors, vs. letting exceptions be thrown and then catch them?

    String[] q4_why_is_it_better_to_anticipate_and_prevent_errors = { " It is usually better to anticipate and prevent errors, instead of using try-catch blocks, because:

            It is more efficient to prevent errors from occurring in the first place than to catch and handle them at runtime. Preventing errors can improve the performance of the code.
    Anticipating and preventing errors can make the code more robust and reliable, as it reduces the likelihood of unexpected behavior. This can improve the user experience and make the code easier to maintain." };  // TODO fill this in. At least 2 reasons.
