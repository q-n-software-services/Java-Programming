/**
 *
 * Storage for Resolved Ticket objects.
 * Implemented as a "Singleton" - there can only ever be one ResolvedTicketStore.
 * This avoids the possibility of creating multiple stores, and then
 * If there is only one ResolvedTicketStore, then all the the tickets must be in this
 * single store.  There's no way to have multiple stores and multiple places where tickets might be.
 *
 * Singleton is a design pattern, a way of doing things in code. More info:
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-class-java/
 *
 * If you want to work with the ResolvedTicketStore, call ResolvedTicketStore.getInstance()
 *
 * You don't need to modify this class.
 *
 * You will need to call the addTicket method.
