    // String q1_pros_of_checked_exceptions =
        /*" Checked exceptions in Java have the following advantages:

    They aid in ensuring that programmers address any exceptions that may arise while a programme is being executed. This increases the code's dependability and resilience.
    Because the code explicitly states the exceptions it may throw, they help the code become more self-documenting. ";*/




   // String q2_cons_of_checked_exceptions =
    /*" The drawbacks of checked exceptions in Java include:

    As programmers must write try-catch blocks or state that a procedure throws an exception, they might make code more verbose. This could make the code more challenging to read and comprehend.
    Because every method that calls a method that throws a checked exception must either catch the exception or explicitly state that it throws the exception, they can make it more difficult to write generic code. This may result in multiple layers of exception handling that are challenging to control.";*/




  //  String q3_your_opinion_on_java_having_checked_and_unchecked_exceptions =
      /*" According to me, using both checked and unchecked exceptions has advantages and disadvantages. This is the case with Java. As they force developers to deal with probable exceptions, checked exceptions might, on the one hand, serve to increase the dependability and robustness of the code. However, they can also make the code more verbose, more difficult to read, and more difficult to build generic code.";*/





    // Why is it often better to anticipate and try to prevent errors, vs. letting exceptions be thrown and then catch them?

   // String q4_why_is_it_better_to_anticipate_and_prevent_errors =
            /*Instead of utilising try-catch blocks, it is generally preferable to anticipate and avoid problems for the following reasons:

            Instead of catching and handling mistakes during runtime, it is more effective to prevent them from happening in the first place. Error prevention can enhance the code's performance.
    Because unexpected behaviour is less likely when errors are anticipated and prevented, the code becomes more resilient and trustworthy. This can enhance user experience and make code maintenance simpler." }; */
